                <img src="assets/images/matera 1.jpg" class="destra">
                <p>Located in the southern Italian region of Basilicata, The Sassi and the Park of the Rupestrian
                    Churches of Matera comprises a complex of houses, churches, monasteries and hermitages built into
                    the natural caves of the Murgia. Covering an area of 1,016 ha this remarkable and intact troglodyte
                    settlement contains more than a thousand dwellings and a large number of shops and workshops. The
                    property was first occupied during the Palaeolithic period and shows evidence of continuous human
                    occupation through several millennia until the present day, and is harmoniously integrated into the
                    natural terrain and ecosystem.

                    The site is composed of the ancient districts of the city of Matera and of the Park of the
                    Rupestrian Churches which stretch over the Murgia, a calcareous highland plateau characterized by
                    deep fault fissures, ravines, rocks and caves. The morphology of the territory, characterized by
                    deep ravines (gravine) and bare highland plateaus, integrated with ancient cave churches, shepherd
                    tracks marked by wells, and fortified farmhouses, form one of the most evocative landscapes of the
                    Mediterranean.

                <p>The Antigua Naval Dockyard and its Related Archaeological Sites consists of a group of Georgian Naval
                    structures, set within a walled enclosure, on a naturally-occurring series of deep narrow bays
                    surrounded by highlands on which defensive fortifications were constructed. The Dockyard and its
                    related facilities were built at a time when European nations were battling for supremacy of the
                    seas to obtain control over the lucrative sugar-producing islands of the Eastern Caribbean.
                    Antiguaâ€™s location as a front-line naval dockyard facility gave the British navy a strategic
                    advantage over its rivals at a crucial point in history.

                <p>
                    The construction and operation of the Antigua Naval Dockyard were made possible through the labour
                    and skills of enslaved Africans, whose contribution was crucial for the establishment of the
                    facility and, more widely, for the development of the British Empire, trade and industrialization.

                <img src="assets/images/Pupi.jpg" alt="" class="left">
                <p>An ancient and precious art of Sicily, the puppeteers bring puppets to life
                    to tell epic and chivalric stories. These narratives have their roots in
                    medieval literature, including the Carolingian cycle and Arthurian
                    romances. The stories, passed down orally and then published in notes
                    since 1858, combine elements of cultured literature, such as Orlando
                    Innamorato and Orlando Furioso. In addition to the deeds of the Sicilian-
                    Norman sovereigns and historical-novel narratives, the puppeteers also
                    include stories taken from Gerusalemme Liberata, lives of the saints,
                    brigands and Shakespeare's plays, such as Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth.
                    This art form, proclaimed Masterpiece of the oral intangible heritage of
                    humanity, has become a significant part of the historical memory and
                    cultural identity of Sicily, appreciated above all by the popular classes.</p>

                <img src="assets/images/tartufo1.jpg" alt="" class="destra">
                <p>The National Association of Truffle Cities in Italy has filed a candidacy to have the practice of
                    searching
                    for and hunting truffles recognized as a Unesco Intangible Heritage. The association, along with the
                    Ministry of Culture and Tourism, aims to showcase the cultural significance of the truffle and
                    preserve
                    the traditional values and culture associated with it. Over the past five years, the association has
                    worked
                    to make the truffle a shared asset and a part of the identity of the communities and territories
                    where it is
                    found. The association, which now includes 57 municipalities and unions across Italy's
                    truffle-producing
                    regions, promotes other environmental, cultural, historical, traditional, and enogastronomic
                    resources
                    associated with the truffle.

                    The practice of truffle hunting is characterized by an insight into the natural
                    environment and the use of specific tools and techniques that have been passed down through
                    generations. Truffle hunting is a traditional practice that has been passed down through generations
                    in
                    rural areas of the country. Truffle hunters use their knowledge and skills to locate and extract the
                    valuable underground fungus known as truffles. The process involves two stages: identifying the
                    areas
                    where truffles grow, with the help of trained dogs, and carefully extracting them without damaging
                    the
                    soil. Finding truffles requires an understanding of climate, environment, and vegetation, as well as
                    the
                    dynamics between the dog and the hunter. This knowledge is often shared through oral tradition,
                    including stories and expressions that reflect the local culture. Truffle hunting is also associated
                    with
                    popular festivals that mark the beginning and end of the truffle season. Throughout this ancient
                    tradition, there is a focus on respecting ecological balance and biodiversity, ensuring the
                    regeneration of
                    various species.</p>
